			<h2>This player :)</h2>
			<p>
				Since he's playing, in Monaco, PSG or in the French team, I'm really inspired by Kylian Mbappe. His young age show me that everybody can do everything just by the power of work.

				Since I realise that, he became my idole and I went to every of his match. He saw me and now he knows that I'm a huge fan of his work. 

				So often, after his matchs his give me some of his stuffs and I sell it because I don't have enough place in my room to stack all of this stuff.
